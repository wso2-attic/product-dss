    <h1>Step-by-Step Guide on Creating a Data Service Using Cassandra Datasource</h1>
    <p><b>Introduction</b></p>
    <p>WSO2 Data Services Server provides the capability of exposing data from a Cassandra datasource as a service. This guide will explain how a Data Service can be created using a Cassandra datasource.
    </p>
    <p>NOTE: WSO2DSS-3.2.0 has inbuilt support for Cassandra server versions 1.2.5 or later. If you need to use Cassandra server versions older than 1.2.5, then you need to uninstall the cassandra-jdbc-1.2.5 feature using 'Feature Management' and install the cassandra-jdbc-1.1.1/cassandra-jdbc-1.0.5 feature.
    </p>

        <p>Let's begin by creating a simple keyspace add some column family to work with. Here is the Cassandra-cli commands to perform this tasks.</p>
        <p><b>Step 1: Create Keyspace and Column Family</b></p><hr/>
        <p>create keyspace Keyspace1;</p>
        <p>use Keyspace1;</p>
        <p>create column family USER with comparator=UTF8Type and key_validation_class=UTF8Type<br />
                and column_metadata=[{column_name: user_id, validation_class: UTF8Type, index_type: KEYS},<br />
                {column_name: username, validation_class: UTF8Type},<br />
                {column_name: password, validation_class: UTF8Type}];
        </p>
        <p>set USER[user1][username]='dinusha';<br />
              set USER[user1][password]='mypwd';
        </p>

    <p><b>Step 2: Start by giving a name</b>
    </p><hr/>
    <p>Lets begin to create the data service by clicking on the 'Create'
    link in left menu . It requires to enter a name to the Data service. Lets name it as CassandraSampleService
    and click on Next.

    <p>Figure 1: Create Data Service</p>
    <p><b>Step 3: Enter details about your Cassandra datasource</b>
    </p><hr/>
    <p>Next step is to enter details about the datasource which we are
    using to create the service. Select the Datasource Type as "Cassandra" from the drop down list after you giving a name to the datasource.
    </p>
    <p> <img alt="DS" src="images/ds-wizard/cassandra/step2.png"/></p>
    <p>Figure 2: Configure Cassandra datasource</p>
    <p>Created datasource will list and click on "Next" to create the query.</p>
           
    <p><b>Step 4: Create Query</b>
    </p><hr/>
    <p>To extract information you need to create a query along with the
    structure of the response.
    </p>
    <p>Give a name to the query, and select the datasource name from the
    drop down, which is created in previous step. Specify the CQL query and parameters. Save the query once you enter the details.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>Figure 3: Create New Query</p>
    <p>Click on &quot;Add Output Mapping&quot; button to create how the
    output should look like. Once you have entered the output mapping
    details click on &quot;Main Configuration&quot; and click on &quot;Save&quot;
    button.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>Figure 4: Add Output Mappings</p>
    <p>Created query will be listed as follows. Click on &quot;Next&quot;
    to create the operation.</p>

    <p><b>Step 5: Create a web service operation</b> <hr/>
    </p>
    <p>Enter a name for the operation and select the query from the drop
    down list. Click on &quot;Save&quot;.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>Figure 5: Add operation</p>
    <p>Once you click on &quot;Finish&quot; your data service will be
    created and deployed.
    </p>
    <p><b>Step 6: Service deployed</b> <hr/>
    </p>
    <p>You can see the deployed service by clicking on &quot;List&quot;
    under Main/List left menu. Deployed CassandraSampleService service
    will be list as follows.

    </p>
    <p>Figure 6: Deployed Services</p>
    <p>Click on the &quot;CassandraSampleService&quot;. It will direct to
    the Service Dashboard. You can click on &quot;Edit
    Data Service (XML Edit)&quot; and view the created data service as a
    XML.

    <p><b>Step 7: Try your service</b>
    </p><hr/>
    <p>Click on &quot;Try It&quot; link to invoke the service.</p>
